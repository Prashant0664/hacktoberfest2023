# TODO-LIST-PROJECT
###### TODO LIST:
A list of tasks that need to be completed, typically organized in order of priority.
## THIS PROJECT
In this to-do list, the user can add a to-do by filling the input!
 and hit ENTER, after that he can rather check the to-do when it's done, or select and remove multiple items using the delete button.
The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.
There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.
This to-do list app shows the today's date to the user.
